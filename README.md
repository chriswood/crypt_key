crypt_key
=========

Program to crack cryptographs! No more being left out at spy parties!

Attempt 1:
Using only a table of letter usage as sampled from the oxford dictionary,
solving small crytogram puzzles (around 40 characters) using a normailized 
table is not working. To handle a puzzle this small, a more intelligent 
algorithm is needed.

Attempt 2 ideas:
try applying some first letter tests.
try searching for double letters, and substitue common letters like ss or tt.
try last letter matching tests.
